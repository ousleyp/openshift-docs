= About virtual machine instances

A virtual machine instance (VMI) is a representation of a running virtual machine (VM). When a virtual machine instance is owned by a virtual machine or by another object, it is managed through its owner in the web console or by using the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).

A standalone virtual machine is created and started independently with a script, through automation, or other methods in the CLI. In your environment, you might have standalone virtual machine instances that were developed and started outside of the OpenShift virtualization environment. You can continue to manage those standalone virtual machine instances by using the CLI. Alternatively, you can use the web console for specific tasks associated with standalone virtual machine instances:

* List standalone virtual machine instances and their details.

* Edit text and annotations for a standalone virtual machine instance.

* Delete a standalone virtual machine instance.
